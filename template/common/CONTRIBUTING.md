## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project you agree to abide by the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Report unacceptable behavior to `{{CONTACT_EMAIL}}`.

## How to Report Bugs

- **Check existing issues** — someone may have reported it already.
- **Use the issue template** and provide as much detail as possible.
- **Include diagnostics**: version, operating system, exact command, and full output.

## How to Propose Features

- Open an issue using the *Feature request* template.
- Explain **why** the feature is needed and how it fits the project's goals, not only what it does.
- Wait for maintainer feedback before investing significant implementation time.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/{{GITHUB_OWNER}}/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}.git
   cd {{PROJECT_SLUG}}
   ```

2. **Bootstrap the environment**:

   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

3. **Install the Git pre-commit hook** (runs lint + unit tests before each commit):

   ```bash
   make install-hooks
   ```

4. **Run the test suite**:

   ```bash
   make test
   ```

## Coding Standards

All contributions must satisfy the following before being submitted. These checks are enforced
automatically by the CI pipeline.

- **Linting & formatting**: the code must pass `make lint` with no errors or warnings.
- **Shell scripts**: everything under `scripts/` must pass `shellcheck`.
- **Type annotations**: new functions and methods must be fully annotated, consistent with the
  existing codebase.
- **No dead code**: remove unused imports, variables, and commented-out blocks before submitting.
- **Commit messages**: follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`).

> Pull requests that fail `make lint` will not be merged.

## Architectural Principles

<!-- TODO(template): replace these with the principles that actually govern this codebase. -->

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: each module does one thing. Keep presentation logic out
   of core logic.
2. **No UI coupling**: core modules must not import the CLI/UI layer. Use callbacks or return raw data.
3. **Atomic operations**: state-changing operations must be all-or-nothing; never leave the system
   half-configured.
4. **Crash safety**: always consider what happens if the process is killed mid-operation.
5. **Test-driven development**: every new feature or bug fix ships with a corresponding test.

## Testing

- **Unit tests** must pass on every pull request. They are fully mocked and require no privileges.
- **Integration tests** run in a container or VM and verify real system behavior.

### When Tests Run

- **Pull requests**: every pull request triggers the CI pipeline — linting, static analysis, and the
  unit test matrix.
- **Push to `main`**: the same suite runs on any push to the default branch.
- **Locally**: run `make verify` before opening a pull request.

### Interpreting Results

- **Green**: ready for review.
- **Red**: blocks the merge. Review the logs, fix, and push an update.

### Test Policy for Major Changes

A change is **major** if it adds a significant feature, alters a security boundary, or changes the
crash-safety architecture. For major changes the contributor **must**:

- Add new unit tests covering the functionality.
- Update existing tests when the expected behavior changes.
- Run the integration suite manually and report the result in the pull request.

Pull requests are blocked from merging if tests do not sufficiently cover the change.

## Documentation Requirements

Every change must keep the documentation in sync with the code. The exact files to update for each
type of change are defined in **[`docs/documentation-policy.md`](docs/documentation-policy.md)**.
At minimum, every user-visible change requires a [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) entry.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

By contributing to {{PROJECT_SHORT}} you certify that you have the right to submit the contribution
under the project's {{LICENSE_ID}} license, and you agree to the
[Developer Certificate of Origin v1.1](https://developercertificate.org/).

**Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by` line** with your real name and email:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
```

The easiest way to add it is the `-s` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "your commit message"
```

For multiple commits in a branch, sign them off at once:

```bash
git rebase --signoff HEAD~<number-of-commits>
```

> Pull requests with unsigned commits will not be merged. The DCO check is enforced by CI.

    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Ensure `make verify` passes locally.
3. Update the documentation required by [`docs/documentation-policy.md`](docs/documentation-policy.md).
4. Fill in the pull request template checklist honestly.
5. Submit the pull request and wait for review. Expect a first response within **7 days**.

Thank you for your help!

## Security Best Practices for GitHub Actions

When contributing workflows or modifying CI pipelines, follow these guidelines to prevent injection
attacks.

### 1. Never interpolate untrusted data directly into shell commands

**Bad** (vulnerable to script injection):

```yaml
- run: echo "PR title: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"
```

**Good** (use environment variables):

```yaml
- env:
    PR_TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
  run: echo "PR title: $PR_TITLE"
```

### 2. Avoid `pull_request_target` unless strictly necessary

This trigger runs in the context of the base repository and can expose secrets to malicious code from
a fork. Prefer `pull_request`.

### 3. Pin actions to a full commit SHA

Third-party actions must be pinned to an immutable commit SHA, not a mutable tag:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11 # v4.1.1
```

### 4. Limit `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions

Declare the minimum permissions at workflow level:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

### 5. Sanitize inputs from issue and comment bodies

If user-provided text must be used, validate it against an allowlist or escape it before passing it
to a script.

### 6. Run untrusted code in isolated containers

For actions that execute code from pull requests, run them inside a container with no access to
secrets.
